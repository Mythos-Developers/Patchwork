# Patchwork
A mod by Mythos that adds a bunch of stuff, including (but not limited to) enchantments, armor, materials, items, weapons, commands, and more! 

Patchwork has moved to beta development, I'll always be adding more stuff, but might be getting closer to an actual stable-ish release! Hopefully. Maybe. We'll see.
